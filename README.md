Tool that will sync time entries from [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).

Written because Jira UI for adding time entries is kind of slow.
With Toggl you have a dedicated desktop app, so you can start/resume tasks with just 1 click.

You can also use [Toggl Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-track-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn) to add 'Start entry' button directly on Jira ticket. then you use this tool to sync back time entries to Jira.
